# MobaCam-Movement

I tried recreate a league of legend like camera and deplacement system in unity.

I used C# and Unity3D Environnement

#1.Camera system

I needed to make a lockable/unlockable camera which focus on the player object.

The camera also needed the ability to zoom/dezoom.
It needed to keep its recoil when the locked camera was blocked by the map edge
